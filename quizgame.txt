Answer:
A queue is a linear data structure following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front. Common operations include enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

Question:

Answer:
A stack is a linear data structure following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. Common operations include push, pop, and peek.

Question:
What is a Heap?

Answer:
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, typically in the form of a binary tree. It can be visualized as a balanced tree where each node has at most two children. Heaps are commonly used for priority queues and efficient sorting algorithms.

Question:

It allows developers to access and use functions, data, or services from other software systems. APIs simplify the development process and promote software reusability.

Question:
What is Big O notation?

Answer:
Big O notation is a way to express the performance of an algorithm by describing its time complexity or space complexity. It represents the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate, showing how the runtime or space requirements increase as the input size grows. Common time complexities include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2).

Question:
What is a Linked List?

Answer:
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be singly-linked (each node points to the next node) or doubly-linked (each node points to both the previous and next nodes). Common operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Question:
What is a Hash Table?

Answer:
A hash table is a data structure that provides fast insertion, deletion, and search operations by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an underlying array. Each key is unique, and the hash function ideally distributes keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions. In case of collisions, various techniques such as open addressing and separate chaining can be employed to resolve them.

Question:
What is recursion?

Answer:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It breaks the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems and combines the results of these subproblems to form the final solution. Recursive functions typically have a base case (the smallest problem that can be solved directly) and a recursive case (where the function calls itself with a smaller input).

Question:
What is a Graph?

Answer:
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and edges connecting these vertices. Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). They can be used to represent various real-world relationships and problems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and flow networks. Common graph algorithms include depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's shortest path, and the minimum spanning tree.

Question:
What is the difference between a process and a thread?

Answer:
A process is an instance of a running program, having its own memory space and resources. A thread is a lightweight, concurrent unit of execution within a process, sharing the process's memory and resources.

Question:

Relational databases use tables with predefined schemas and relations between them, while NoSQL databases use various data models like key-value, document, or graph without fixed schemas. NoSQL databases are typically more scalable and flexible compared to relational databases.

Question:
What is the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm in the average and worst cases?

Answer:
Quicksort's average-case time complexity is O(n log n), while its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). However, with proper pivot selection, the worst case can be avoided in practice.

Question:
What is a race condition in concurrent programming?

Answer:
A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads are scheduled to run, leading to unpredictable and undesirable outcomes.

Question:
What is the difference between Git's merge and rebase operations?

What is the main difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in the context of data structures?

Answer:
A shallow copy creates a new object with references to the same inner elements as the original object, while a deep copy creates a new object with completely independent copies of all inner elements, ensuring no shared references between the original and copied objects.

Question:
What is the difference between static and dynamic typing in programming languages?

Answer:
Static typing enforces type checking at compile-time, catching type-related errors before the program runs, while dynamic typing performs type checking at runtime, allowing for more flexibility but potentially leading to type-related errors during program execution.

Answer:
A stateful application maintains information about its state and the state of its clients between requests, while a stateless application does not store any information about the state of the application or its clients, making each request independent of any previous requests.

Question:
What is the purpose of a Dependency Injection (DI) pattern in software design?

Answer:
Dependency Injection is a pattern that decouples dependencies between objects, promoting flexibility, maintainability, and testability by injecting dependencies (usually interfaces) into objects, rather than directly instantiating them within the objects.

Question:
What is the main difference between a NoSQL database and a relational database?

Answer:
A NoSQL database is a non-relational database that uses a variety of data models for storing and managing data, providing flexibility, scalability, and performance for large-scale or unstructured data, while a relational database uses a structured schema and tables with relations to store and manage data, providing strong consistency and data integrity.

Question:
What is an optimistic concurrency control mechanism in the context of databases?

Answer:
Optimistic concurrency control is a mechanism that allows multiple transactions to access shared resources simultaneously, assuming conflicts are rare, and validating transactions only when they are committed, improving performance at the cost of occasional conflict resolution.

Question:
What is a race condition in the context of concurrent programming?

Answer:
A race condition occurs when two or more concurrent processes or threads access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable or undesirable behavior due to the dependency on the relative timing of events.

Question:
What is the main difference between imperative and declarative programming?

Answer:
Imperative programming focuses on how a computation is performed, describing the sequence of steps to achieve a result, while declarative programming focuses on what the desired result is, specifying the desired output without detailing the steps to achieve it.

Question:
What is the purpose of a Proxy design pattern in object-oriented programming?

Answer:
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object, controlling access to the original object, allowing for additional functionality, such as lazy initialization, caching, or access control, without modifying the original object's behavior.
