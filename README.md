Quiz Game
This quiz game is a simple Python program that reads questions and answers from a text file and presents them to the user. The user can choose the number of questions they want to answer, and after each question, they can decide if they want to see the correct answer. The game will then ask if they got the question right, and at the end, the user will receive a grade based on the number of correct answers.

Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Place the quizgame.txt file in the same directory as the Python script.
Run the Python script using a terminal or command prompt: python quiz_game.py
Follow the prompts to answer questions and view the answers.
Text File Format
The quizgame.txt file should contain questions and answers in the following format:

Question:

Question:
What is a Queue?

Answer:
A queue is a linear data structure following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front. Common operations include enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
Each question and answer should be separated by a "Question:" and "Answer:" label. There should be no additional formatting or characters in the file.

Improper User Input Handling
The quiz game expects users to input either "yes" or "no" when asked whether they want to see the answer or whether they got the question right. If the user provides any input other than "yes" or "no", the game will consider it as a negative response and proceed accordingly.

When asked for the number of questions to be answered, the program expects an integer value. If the user provides an invalid input (e.g., a string, float, or negative number), the program will raise an error and exit. To ensure a smooth user experience, input the desired number of questions as a positive integer.

For the best experience, follow the prompts and input data according to the instructions provided by the quiz game.
